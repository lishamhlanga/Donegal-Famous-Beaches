This website is for everyone who love adventure, outgoing, family out, .Audience is all ages .

To do this project I had 3 choices in mind a DIY website, Helpline Website, ad lastly Donegal Best Beaches. The reason I choose the Donegal Famous beaches i found that mant people were not aware of how beautiful the coastal drive is and housing beautiful oustanding baeches athat rank higher in the world. I love taking my family to the beach so one time i tried to find baeches in donegaland it wasnt an easy find. Thi website idea isto help people who love ourdoors, adventure, nature and families to be able to view and have info in regard to nearest lovely beaches.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

                    About us
                </h1>
                <p>We are a community of friends in the end of Ireland. Having lived in this beautiful country for most
                    of our lives we’ve managed to explore almost everything that Ireland has to offer.

                    We started “Donegal Famous Beaches” to help anyone planning to travel to Ireland on vacation and and
                    also to the residents of Ireland to be able to find and locate easily the best beaches of Ireland.
                </p>

                <p> Currently we are concentrating on the County Donegal area. Our ultimate goal is to cover the whole
                    country with every beach listed on our website. As we have travelled a lot around Ireland and
                    visited almost all areas of interest , what we
                    found out was that as much as people have knowledge of different beaches there were some beaches
                    which were unknown to them.
                </p>

                <p style="color: red">This website is aimed at anyone planning or looking for that adventure of their
                    lifetime that will bring memories and smiles..
                </p>

                <p>We have included an upload link that will enable one to upload pictures as well as write something
                    about their favourite beach. Once uploaded we will look at it and then publish it on the site as per
                    the category selected on the form. Credit
                    will be highlighted beneath the post with initials only for privacy purposes.
